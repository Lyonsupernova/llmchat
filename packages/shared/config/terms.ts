### Terms of Service

Effective Date: July 2, 2025
Last Updated: July 2, 2025

Welcome to Experts AI. By using our website and services, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the platform.

### 1. About Our Service

Experts AI provides AI-generated legal information that is reviewed and endorsed by licensed professionals before being finalized. We help users access fast and trustworthy legal guidance — but use of the platform does not create an attorney-client relationship unless explicitly stated.

### 2. No Attorney-Client Relationship

You are not forming an attorney-client relationship unless both of the following conditions are met:
• You receive a response explicitly endorsed by a licensed attorney, and
• That attorney confirms their identity and formally acknowledges the creation of a professional relationship.

### 3. For Informational Use Only

All content delivered via Experts AI is for informational purposes only. Responses are based solely on the information you provide and are not substitutes for comprehensive legal advice or representation.

### 4. Your Responsibilities

You agree not to:
• Misrepresent facts or omit key information in your legal query
• Misuse the platform to obtain legal advice without disclosing relevant details
• Violate any laws or infringe upon third-party rights

### 5. Payments

The core service is offered free of charge. Optional features — such as priority support, exceeding monthly question limits, or other enhancements — may incur fees. Payments are processed via a third-party provider and are non-refundable unless otherwise specified.

### 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:
• Experts AI is not liable for any loss or damage arising from errors in user-submitted information or the use of responses generated on the platform.
• Licensed professionals who endorse responses are providing limited-scope input for informational purposes only and do not assume responsibility beyond the review provided.
• No guarantee is made as to the completeness, timeliness, or applicability of any response.
• You assume full responsibility for how you use the information, and agree not to hold Experts AI or any affiliated professionals liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

### 7. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Your continued use of the platform after changes are posted indicates your acceptance of the revised Terms.
